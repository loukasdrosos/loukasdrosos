**`Software Craftsman`**

I'm a Software Engineer building my version of the digital world one step at a time.

I am a graduate student from the Department of Physics at National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, with a big interest in Computer Science. 
Currently in my second year of MSc in Control and Computing at National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, developing and designing computer systems. 
In my coding journey so far i am learning as much as possible trying to become better every day, with my end goal being to apply all of my theoretical knowledge into real-life applications and create fun and useful projects with code.
